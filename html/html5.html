    The word "embed" has
    been mentioned in 
    Interactive content article
    in the context of <code>video</code>
    and <code>audio</code> elements, 
    as well as images.
    But what if we want to embed another
    website, which is actually another
    HTML document located somewhere on
    the web? At first, it sounds like
    a brilliant idea, let's get 
    further into this topic.

        Again, let's refer to MDN
        for a short history lesson:
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        A long time ago on the Web, it was popular to use 
        frames to create websites - small parts of a website 
        stored in individual HTML pages. These were embedded 
        in a master document called a frameset, which allowed 
        you to specify the area on the screen that each frame filled, 
        rather like sizing the columns and rows of a table. 
        These were considered the height of coolness in the mid to late 90s,
        and there was evidence that having a webpage split up into smaller
        chunks like this was better for download speeds - especially 
        noticeable with network connections being so slow back then. 
        They did however have many problems, which far outweighed any positives
        as network speeds got faster, so you don't see them being used anymore.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        A little while later (late 90s, early 2000s), plugin technologies became 
        very popular, such as Java Applets and Flash - these allowed web developers to 
        embed rich content into webpages such as videos and animations, which just weren't
        available through HTML alone. Embedding these technologies was achieved through 
        elements like <code>&lt;object&gt;</code>, and the lesser-used <code>&lt;embed&gt;</code>, 
        and they were very useful at the time. 
        They have since fallen out of fashion due to many problems, including accessibility, 
        security, file size, and more; these days most mobile devices don't support such
        plugins anymore, and desktop support is on the way out.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        Finally, the <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> element appeared 
        (along with other ways of embedding content, such as <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;video&gt;</code>, etc.) 
        This provides a way to embed an entire web document inside another one, 
        as if it were an <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> or other such element, and is used regularly today.
        With the history lesson out of the way, let's move on and see how to use some of these.

    <p>
        Iframes elements are designed to allow you to embed other web documents into the current document. 
        This is great for incorporating third-party content into your website that you might not have direct control 
        over and don't want to have to implement your own version of, such as maps, video/image hostings, ads, etc.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        In fact, most popular online content platforms (YouTube, Google Maps, Twitter, Facebook, etc.) provide you 
        with a way to embed their content in your website using at <code>iframe</code>. The code snippets
        are usually specified in the "Share" or "Embed" sections. Try embedding something yourself!
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        The <code>iframe</code> element has some advanced features available via it's attributes,
        But for the most basic usage, the <code>src</code> attribute should be specified.
        As you might have guessed, it contains a link the the website you would like to embed.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        Finally, there are a few serious security concern revolving around embeding content.
        I won't go into detail on them here, but as a rule of thumb, only use 
        iframes when it is absolutely necessary. Fore more information, see the
        references.
