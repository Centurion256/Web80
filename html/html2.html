    We already mentioned that HTML
    uses elements to logically structure
    a page. But how do we do that?
    In order to speparate and distinguish
    elements, HTML uses tags. 
    Tags basically tell the reader
    which element they're looking at,
    what properties does it have and 
    where does it end. Tag is the 
    very basic component that 
    describes the web page, all content
    is in some tag or another. There 
    are numerous tag for different 
    purposes, we will only look at
    a few of them in this tutorial, but you
    can find an exhaustive list in the
    references.

<div>
    <p>
    Let's look at this example from MDN:
    Suppose you wanted to represent the
    sentence 
    </p>

    <div style="text-align: center;">My cat is very grumpy</div>
    <p>
    in HTML. Since this is our only
    sentence, it is reasonable
    to put it in a paragraph,
    just like we would in play english.
    In terms of HTML, this would 
    mean that we have to represent it
    as a "paragraph" element. Luckily, 
    HTML has a <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag.
    That is good to know, but how 
    do we specify that our sentence
    should be a paragraph?
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        HTML has an answer: wrap
        the text with the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>
        tag, like so:
    </p>
    <img src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/9347/grumpy-cat-small.png" alt="">
    <p>
        Here, <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> is used to
        denote the beginning of the tag, and
        <code>&lt;/p&gt;</code> - the ending.
        Simple, right?
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        Elements may also have different
        attributes, what would distinguish them
        from other similar elements or make it
        easier to classify them. This will 
        be further elaborated upon in our next
        section.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p> There are some other important properties,
        for exapmple we can nest elements inside
        other elements. Some elements also 
        may be empty, and contain no other
        content but their name and attributes.
        A good example would be a <code>&lt;br&gt;</code>
        element, which simply breaks the line.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        To conclude, writing good HTML is basically
        finding the correct tags to use in 
        a given occasion. There is another
        important divison of HTML elements:
        Semantic and Non-semantic.
    </p>
    <p>
        Semantic elements are elements which
        are clearly descriptive of their content,
        e.g. <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> always
        should be used to denote a paragraph,
        <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> denotes a break
        in the line, <code>&lt;img&gt;</code>
        contains an image, etc.
        Most HTML elements are semantic.
        Does this, however, imply that they are
        the most commonly used? Suprisingly, no.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        Non-semantic elements are generic elements:
        they tell nothing about the content,
        just that there is some divison.
        Two most common non-semantic elements
        are  <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> and
        <code>&lt;span&gt;</code>, the first
        (by default) used for block separation
        and the latter for inline. These two,
        <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> especially,
        are very commonly used.
        The reason is that while they tell
        nothing about the content explicitly,
        they do, combined with
        appropriate attributes, divide the
        page logically. This is especially
        useful for CSS and scripting
        languages, but more on that later.

    <p>We now know what elements are
        and how to represent them in HTML.
        But what does the entire HTML page
        consist of?
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>The first line should ALWAYS be
        <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code>.
        Nowadays, this doesn't really
        represent anything, but in the
        past it was used to represent
        a ruleset/convension that the document
        would follow. Nowadays, 
        this is obsolete, but
        the line still remains. 
        Always remember to contain it
        at the top of the document.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        Next is the <code>html</code> element.
        It is known as the root element that
        encloses the content of your document.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        The <code>head</code> element is
        used for content that describes the
        page itself, but isn't displayed
        to the end user. This doesn't mean
        that it doesn't affect the rest of
        the document: in fact it does, since
        such information as the title of
        the document, keywords for
        search engines, character encoding,
        links to external
        content that is used, such as
        CSS styles, fonts or external libraries,
        etc. We won't cover a lot of it in this
        tutorial, but more information is 
        available in the references.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        The <code>body</code> element is
        where most of the content of the
        document is located.

        Take a look at the source code
        of this webpage. Do you see
        the document structure described
        above? Do you recognize some
        of the elements? Can you 
        guess what some of the attributes
        mean?
