    By now, if you have
    read all the previous
    articles, looked at the source code
    and opened the tag/attribute
    references, you know the
    very basics of HTML. In fact,
    you probably can recreate this website
    in it's entirety! (without, of course, the
    styles). But let's take a look at
    a few other important features of HTML
</p>
<br>
<p> 
    Modern HTML allows us to insert very advanced
    elements, which are essential to some of the
    biggest platforms on the web today: video
    and audio. MDN describes them perfectly:
</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>
    Web developers have wanted to use video and audio
    on the Web for a long time, ever since the early
    2000s when we started to have bandwidth fast enough
    to support any kind of video (video files are much
    larger than text or even images.) In the early days,
    native web technologies such as HTML didn't have the
    ability to embed video and audio on the Web, so proprietary
    (or plugin-based) technologies like Flash (and later, Silverlight)
    became popular for handling such content. 
    This kind of technology worked ok, but it had a number of problems, 
    including not working well with HTML/CSS features, security issues, 
    and accessibility issues.    
</p>
<br>
<p>
    A native solution would solve much of this if implemented correctly. 
    Fortunately, a few years later the HTML5 specification had such features added, 
    with the <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> elements, 
    and some shiny new JavaScript APIs for controlling them. 
    We'll not be looking at JavaScript here - just the basic foundations that can be achieved with HTML.

    <p>
        Let's look at the elements themselves.
        The <code>video</code> element allows you
        to embed a video. It's notable attributes are:
        <ul>
            <li><code>src</code> - specifies the URL/path to the video content</li>
            <li><code>controls</code> - allows user to control video playback</li>
            <li><code>width</code> and <code>height</code> - sets the width and height of the videoplayer</li>
            <li><code>autoplay</code> - plays the video automatically</li>
            <li><code>loop</code> - loops the video playback</li>
        </ul>
        The content inside the <code>video</code> tag is the so-called fallback content:
        it will be displayed in case the browser doesn't support video elements.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        The <code>audio</code> element works similarly to <code>video</code>,
        except that it doesn't support the <code>width</code> and <code>height</code>
        attributes. It is also a good practice to add a child <code>track</code>
        element, in order to make the content more accessible by providing
        captions and a transcript. You can read more about the <code>track</code>
        element on MDN.
