# Web80
Learn HTML/CSS in the 80's style

This website was created with the help of Jinja. 
In order to render the templates, run `python jinjify.py`. 
The `index.html` and the `html` directory have been automatically generated by the python script. Do not view/edit these.
They have been published in order to allow hosting via github pages. Instead, edit the corresponding files in the `templates` folder.
