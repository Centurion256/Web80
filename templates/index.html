        This is a website for all those
        who would like to learn more about
        how the web works, but have
        always been perplexed by the 
        the rapid pace at which it is
        advancing and the sheer 
        number of all the new
        technologies arriving to the 
        market every day.

        It's true, unfortunately, the
        current state of the art 
        web stack is nothing but 
        a mess: the sad state of JS,
        Web 2.0 being virtually dead, 
        a whole park of frameworks
        that supposedly make your life
        easier and numerous "workarounds"
        which make you question the 
        sanity of their creators. Even
        Tim Berners Lee has long since
        acknowledged that Web is going
        nowhere.

        But here, we will try to
        lock at web technologies in a simple
        and systematic way: no overcomplicated
        technologies, just pure idiomatic
        HTML5 and CSS. This tutorial probably
        won't teach you what it takes to be
        a contemporary web developer, but rather
        will, hopefully, give you a different look at what
        the Web could've been and, perhaps, 
        should've been. I work a lot with
        technology from the past decade,
        specifically with hardware and software
        based on the Z80 CPU and it's descendants.
        At that time, technologies were far simpler
        for the developer (albeit less accessible
        for the user) than they are now, so
        let us imagine that we're front end
        developers from the 80'ies and that we have
        limited technologies (only HTML and CSS).
        Hopefully, by the end of this series, 
        you will be able to recreate this
        website from scratch by yourself.

        Below is the table of contents. The tutorial
        is separated into two parts: HTML and CSS.
        If a concept that was covered on a page 
        was used while developing the this website,
        it will be mentioned in the "Applications"
        section. Finally, make sure to visit all the
        references if you want to know more.
