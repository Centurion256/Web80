HTML: Attributes
{% endblock %}

<div>
<p>
    In the previous
    section we 
    mentioned that
    elements can 
    have attributes 
    and that these
    attributes can
    either somehow identify
    the element or set 
    some of  it's properties.
</p>
<br>
<p>
    Consider the example
    from the previous 
    page. If we add
    an attribute
    <code>class</code> to it,
    and set it to some value,
    we'll get this:
</p>
<img src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/9345/grumpy-cat-attribute-small.png" alt="">
<p>
    In this case, <code>class</code>
    attribute allows you to give
    an element an identifying name,
    that can be used to target said
    element by CSS.
</p>
<br>
<p>
    All HTML attributes have the following
    properties:
    <ul>
        <li>All HTML elements can have attributes</li>
        <li>Attributes provide additional information about an element</li>
        <li>Attributes are always specified in the start tag</li>
        <li>An attribute should have a space between it and the element name or the previous attribute</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<br>
<p>
    While most attributes come in <code>attribute=value</code> pairs,
    some attributes can only have the values <code>true</code>
    or <code>false</code>, therefore if their name is present,
    their value is considered to be <code>true</code>, otherwise
    it is <code>false</code>. Such attributes are called Boolean attributes.
</p>
<br>
<p>
    There is another distinction between the atributes: global and element-specific.
</p>
<br>
<p>
    Global attributes are attributes common to all HTML elements; 
    they can be used on all elements, though they may have no effect on some elements.
    <code>class</code> is one example of such attributes, it can be
    present on any element, and use used to identify groups of elements.
    Another such element is <code>id</code>. It serves a similar purpose
    as class, but there must exist only one unique element associated
    with one unique id, while multiple elements can have the same class.
</p>
<br>
<p>
    Non-global or element-specific attributes are attributes that can be
    present only on specific set of attributes, and can have different
    meanings in each of them. They also tend to have some reserved
    values associated with them. An example would be the <code>href</code>
    attribute of the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element.
    <br>
    Element <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> or the "anchor"element is used
    to create a link to another document. The content of the element
    is it's content representation(most commonly text), while
    the <code>href</code> attribute is used to actually specify 
    the URL.
</p>
</div>
<div>
    {{getheader("Applications")}}
</div>
<div>
    <p>
        All the links on this page are
        created using the <code>href</code>
        attribute. Also, notice the
        classes and ids used throughout
        the document. Can you guess some of
        their meanings?
